## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a PoE fiber media converter?  
A PoE fiber media converter is a device that converts Ethernet signals to fiber while simultaneously supplying Power over Ethernet to connected devices such as IP cameras or access points.

### Why use a PoE fiber media converter instead of copper-only PoE?  
Fiber allows longer transmission distances, greater bandwidth, and immunity to electromagnetic interference compared to copper-only Ethernet solutions.

### Can PoE fiber media converters power devices over fiber?  
PoE power is delivered over the copper Ethernet port to the end device, while the fiber link is used for long-distance data transmission between network segments.
